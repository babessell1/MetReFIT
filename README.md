# TracerGFA
A brute force algorithm for identifying missing reactions in a constraint based maize (or other C4 plant) metabolic model based on ortholog data of taxonomically similar species.

One of my first programming related projects that I ultimately abandoned when a paper came out with a pathway-tools integrated program accomplishing the same goal as me at 1000x the speed. If you have need for an algorithm like this, I would recommend checking out this paper https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/36/6/1823/5613176?redirectedFrom=fulltext before trying to use this tool for your own project.
